Subject: [PATCH 086/153] ds2760_battery: Fix calculation of time_to_empty_now

A check against division by zero was modified in commit b0525b48.
Since this change time_to_empty_now is always reported as zero
while the battery is discharging and as a negative value while
the battery is charging. This is because current is negative while
the battery is discharging.

Fix the check introduced by commit b0525b48 so that time_to_empty_now
is reported correctly during discharge and as zero while charging.

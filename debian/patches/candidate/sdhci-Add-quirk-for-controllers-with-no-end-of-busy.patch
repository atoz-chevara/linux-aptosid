Subject: [PATCH 4/4] sdhci: Add quirk for controllers with no end-of-busy IRQ

The Samsung SDHCI (and FSL eSDHC) controller block seems to fail
to generate an INT_DATA_END after the transfer has completed and
the bus busy state finished.

Changes in e809517f6fa5803a5a1cd56026f0e2190fc13d5c to use the
new busy method are the cause of the behaviour change.

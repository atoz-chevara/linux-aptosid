Subject: [PATCH 129/162] xen: mmu: correctly initialize partial p2m leaf

This fixes a crash on early boot in Xen with certain amounts of guest
memory defined. It has hit Linus tree but needs modifications to apply
to 2.6.37 (which is why this comes separate). Does only apply to .37,
before that there was no Xen code in the mainline tree.

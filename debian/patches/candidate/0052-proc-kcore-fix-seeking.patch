Subject: [PATCH 052/134] /proc/kcore: fix seeking

Commit 34aacb2920 ("procfs: Use generic_file_llseek in /proc/kcore") broke
seeking on /proc/kcore.  This changes it back to use default_llseek in
order to restore the original behavior.

The problem with generic_file_llseek is that it only allows seeks up to
inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes, which is 2GB-1 on procfs, where the memory file
offset values in the /proc/kcore PT_LOAD segments may exceed or start
beyond that offset value.

A similar revert was made for /proc/vmcore.

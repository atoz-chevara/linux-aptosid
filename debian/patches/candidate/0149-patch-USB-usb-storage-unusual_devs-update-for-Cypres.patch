This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    USB: usb-storage: unusual_devs update for Cypress ATACB

to my usb git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git
in the usb-linus branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will hopefully also will be merged in Linus's tree for the
next -rc kernel release.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: [PATCH 7946/8274] dm mpath: flush keventd queue in destructor

The commit fe9cf30eb8186ef267d1868dc9f12f2d0f40835a moves dm table event
submission from kmultipath queue to kernel kevent queue to avoid a
deadlock.

There is a possibility of race condition because kevent queue is not flushed
in the multipath destructor. The scenario is:
- some event happens and is queued to keventd
- keventd thread is delayed due to scheuling latency or some other work
- multipath device is destroyed
- keventd now attempts to process work_struct that is residing in already
  released memory.

The patch flushes the keventd queue in multipath constructor.
I've already fixed similar bug in dm-raid1.

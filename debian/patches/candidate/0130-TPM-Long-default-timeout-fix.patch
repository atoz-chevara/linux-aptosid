Subject: [PATCH 130/190] TPM: Long default timeout fix

If duration variable value is 0 at this point, it's because
chip->vendor.duration wasn't filled by tpm_get_timeouts() yet.
This patch sets then the lowest timeout just to give enough
time for tpm_get_timeouts() to further succeed.

This fix avoids long boot times in case another entity attempts
to send commands to the TPM when the TPM isn't accessible.

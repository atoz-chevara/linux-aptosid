Subject: [PATCH] mac80211: fix for incorrect sequence number on hostapd 
	injected frames
From:	=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Bj=F6rn_Smedman?= <bjorn.smedman@venatech.se>

When hostapd injects a frame, e.g. an authentication or association
response, mac80211 looks for a suitable access point virtual interface
to associate the frame with based on its source address. This makes it
possible e.g. to correctly assign sequence numbers to the frames.

A small typo in the ethernet address comparison statement caused a
failure to find a suitable ap interface. Sequence numbers on such
frames where therefore left unassigned causing some clients
(especially windows-based 11b/g clients) to reject them and fail to
authenticate or associate with the access point. This patch fixes the
typo in the address comparison statement.

Subject: [PATCH v2] block: avoid false positive warnings on ioctl to partition
Date:	Fri, 17 Feb 2012 08:38:58 +0100

After a month of reports, the warnings from non-whitelisted ioctls to
a partitions can be classified in three groups.

BLKFLSBUF and BLKROSET are always sent to devices.  Not having them in
the whitelist did not cause any visible harm, but anyway they can and
should be added to the whitelist.

Many unrecognized ioctls are sent to partitions as an attempt to probe for
CD-ROMs, floppies and other kinds of devices.  Like CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY,
they can be blocked safely.

Of the actual SCSI ioctls, only SG_IO was reported in the wild (twice).
udev's scsi_id can issue INQUIRY commands if passed a partition; this
only occurs with custom rules and is strictly speaking invalid, but we
need a transition period so that people can fix their configuration.
zfs-fuse also can issue SYNCHRONIZE CACHE commands, where it should
simply use fdatasync.

Therefore, this patch silently blocks all ioctls except SG_IO, since
all of them turned out to be false positives; in case some escaped, it
should be easily diagnosable or at least bisectable.  The warning text
is separated for root and non-root.  The warning for SG_IO is left in
because a) it will alert users to possible bugs, and b) we do want to
hear about more uses in the wild.  However, no deprecation period is
set for now.

	patch or something similar hits Linus's tree.

+config SQUASHFS
+	tristate "SquashFS 4.0 - Squashed file system support"
+	depends on BLOCK
+	select ZLIB_INFLATE
+	help
+	  Saying Y here includes support for SquashFS 4.0 (a Compressed
+	  Read-Only File System).  Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only
+	  filesystem for Linux.  It uses zlib compression to compress both
+	  files, inodes and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small
+	  and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes
+	  greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 1 Mbytes (default
+	  block size 128K).  SquashFS 4.0 supports 64 bit filesystems and files
+	  (larger than 4GB), full uid/gid information, hard links and
+	  timestamps.  
+
+	  Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for
+	  archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in
+	  embedded systems where low overhead is needed.  Further information
+	  and tools are available from http://squashfs.sourceforge.net.
+
+	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
+	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
+	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
+	  will be called squashfs.  Note that the root file system (the one
+	  containing the directory /) cannot be compiled as a module.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config SQUASHFS_EMBEDDED
+
+	bool "Additional option for memory-constrained systems" 
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	default n
+	help
+	  Saying Y here allows you to specify cache size.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config SQUASHFS_FRAGMENT_CACHE_SIZE
+	int "Number of fragments cached" if SQUASHFS_EMBEDDED
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	default "3"
+	help
+	  By default SquashFS caches the last 3 fragments read from
+	  the filesystem.  Increasing this amount may mean SquashFS
+	  has to re-read fragments less often from disk, at the expense
+	  of extra system memory.  Decreasing this amount will mean
+	  SquashFS uses less memory at the expense of extra reads from disk.
+
+	  Note there must be at least one cached fragment.  Anything
+	  much more than three will probably not make much difference.

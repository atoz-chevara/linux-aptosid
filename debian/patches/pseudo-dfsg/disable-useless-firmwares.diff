+	help
+	  This option allows firmware to be built into the kernel, for the
+	  cases where the user either cannot or doesn't want to provide it from
+	  userspace at runtime (for example, when the firmware in question is
+	  required for accessing the boot device, and the user doesn't want to
+	  use an initrd).
+
+	  This option is a string, and takes the (space-separated) names of the
+	  firmware files -- the same names which appear in MODULE_FIRMWARE()
+	  and request_firmware() in the source. These files should exist under
+	  the directory specified by the EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR option, which is
+	  by default the firmware/ subdirectory of the kernel source tree.
+
+	  So, for example, you might set CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="usb8388.bin",
+	  copy the usb8388.bin file into the firmware/ directory, and build the
+	  kernel. Then any request_firmware("usb8388.bin") will be
+	  satisfied internally without needing to call out to userspace.
+
+	  WARNING: If you include additional firmware files into your binary
+	  kernel image which are not available under the terms of the GPL,
+	  then it may be a violation of the GPL to distribute the resulting
+	  image -- since it combines both GPL and non-GPL work. You should
+	  consult a lawyer of your own before distributing such an image.

+	  The default is the firmware/ directory in the kernel source tree,
+	  but by changing this option you can point it elsewhere, such as
+	  the /lib/firmware/ directory or another separate directory

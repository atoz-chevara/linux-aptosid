This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Linux kernel.
Linux was written by Linus Torvalds <Linus.Torvalds@cs.Helsinki.FI>
and others.

This package was put together by Simon Shapiro <Shimon@i-Connect.Net>, from
sources retrieved from directories under
ftp.cs.helsinki.fi:/pub/Software/Linux/Kernel/
The sources may be found at most Linux ftp sites, including 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/

This package was then maintained by Sven Rudolph.

This package was maintained by Herbert Xu <herbert@debian.org>
from March 1997 to May 2004.

The linux-2.6 package is currently maintained by the
Debian Kernel Team <debian-kernel@lists.debian.org>

This package was forked as "linux-sidux-2.6" to build kernel packages for
sidux in february 2008 by Stefan Lippers-Hollmann <s.l-h@gmx.de> and is 
intended to closely track packaging changes made in debian's (upstream) 
"linux-2.6".
Decisions on kernel configurations and applied patches are made by the sidux
project.
